# EasyQuestSwitch
EasyQuestSwitch is a Unity editor tool developed for VRChat world creators, it can automate changes to components within a scene as soon as the build platform is changed from PC to Android (for Oculus Quest) or vice versa.

## Adding a new localization
It is possible to create your own localizations by creating a new JSON file in VRCPrefabs/EasyQuestSwitch/Resources/EQS_Local/, use en.json as a template.

## Adding custom Types
Tutorial TBD, but you can check VRCPrefabs/EasyQuestSwitch/EQS_Types/ and try to figure it out.
